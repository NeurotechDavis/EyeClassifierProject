# EyeClassifierProject

INTRODUCTION
------------

NeuroAssist is a Brain-Computer Interface that uses eye movements to facilitate effective communication for those affected by paralysis or neurodegenerative diseases that impede day to day speech and mobility abilities.
After training the learning model on the EEG data associated with different eye movements, NeuroAssist compares real time EEG data to classify different eye movement and shows those classifications on a Rasberry Pi.
